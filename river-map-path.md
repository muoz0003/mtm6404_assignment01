## The River Map

Gripping the map tightly, the student chose to trust the river. With every step, the trail marked in faded ink seemed to mirror the path before them. The sound of footsteps had faded, but the feeling of being watched remained.

After an hour of careful hiking, the river widened, forming a calm pool beside a steep rock face. Carved into the stone was a small door—barely visible under moss and vines. The map showed a symbol right at this location: a circle with a triangle inside it.

Heart pounding, the student gently brushed aside the vines, revealing the timeworn door. Cold stone met their fingertips as they traced the faint symbol carved into the surface. A gust of wind carried the scent of damp earth and something older—ancient. Glancing once more at the map, they placed their palm over the circle-and-triangle emblem. The stone shuddered softly, a deep click echoing from within. Slowly, a thin crack opened, releasing a faint blue glow from the darkness beyond. Something unseen had stirred.
