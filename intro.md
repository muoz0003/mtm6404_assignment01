## The story:

It was supposed to be a regular field trip—just another day exploring the trails near campus. But when the group stopped for lunch, one student wandered a little too far. Surrounded now by unfamiliar trees and fading sunlight, they realize they’re lost. With only a backpack, a half-charged phone, and the sound of the wind through the leaves, they must decide: **follow the river deeper into the woods** or **climb the ridge to look for help**?
