## 📖 The Story

> It was supposed to be a regular field trip, just another day exploring the trails near campus.  
> But when the group stopped for lunch, one student wandered a little too far.  
> Surrounded now by unfamiliar trees and fading sunlight, they realize they’re lost.  
> With only a backpack, a half-charged phone, and the sound of the wind through the leaves,  
> they must decide:  
> **Will you _follow the river deeper into the woods_, or _use a mysterious river-map-path_?**
