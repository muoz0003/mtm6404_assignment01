Each step was cautious, the uneven ground hidden beneath fallen leaves a constant tripping hazard. Thorns snagged at their clothes, and the air grew heavy with the damp scent of the earth and the river.

The phone, clutched tightly in their hand, remained stubbornly at two bars, a useless weight. Doubt began to creep in, a cold tendril wrapping around their hope. Had they made the right choice? The river flowed on, indifferent to their fear, leading them further into the heart of the darkening woods.
