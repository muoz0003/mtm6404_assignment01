## Follow the River

The current is gentle, and the sound of the water is strangely comforting. As they walk along the riverbank, they notice signs of lifeâ€”footprints, broken branches, and a distant sound that could be voices... or something else. The path gets narrower, the trees thicker. Just ahead, the river bends sharply. **Do they investigate the sound** or **set up camp before it gets dark**?
