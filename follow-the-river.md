## Follow the river



With a deep breath, the student moved cautiously along the riverbank. The sound of the flowing water was both calming and unsettling, as if the river itself was trying to guide them. The fading light filtered through the trees, casting long shadows across the ground. Their phone, now at 30%, still had no signal, leaving them feeling more isolated with each step.

As they walked, the path narrowed, and the trees grew thicker. The air smelled of damp earth, and the rustling of leaves was the only sound besides the river. After a while, they noticed something strange ahead—a series of large, smooth stones blocking the river's path. On top of one of the stones was an old leather bag, worn and weathered by time.

Curious but cautious, they approached the stones. The bag was partially open, revealing a faded map inside. It looked like it had been left there deliberately—or had someone else been here before?

The wind picked up again, carrying with it a faint, distant sound—like footsteps. Were they alone out here?
